# Crown_gear_mechanism
Reference article: The generation principle and mathematical models of a novel cosine gear drive, Shanming Luo, 14, February, 2008


TOOLS USED:
-Matlab
-ICE SL
-Lua scripting language

-Parametric modelling and simulation crown gear meshing with cosine gear is developed. Parametric model generation helps to avoid rework.
-Develop once and use it multiple times custom requirements.
